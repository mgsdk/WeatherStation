This project aims to create a complete weather station solution for home use, while at the same being a learning experience for me in terms of software and/or hardware development.

The system consists of 3 types of units:
1. Master station. Apart from measuring humidity and temperature, this will receive and log data from the remote stations in the vicinity. These data will be presented to the LAN either by a wired ethernet connection or WiFi. There should also be a local display of the data. Since this station will either be wired (Ethernet) or have a high power consumption (WiFi), it will be assumed to have access to a AC line, and thus not need to conserve power.
2. Indoor remote stations. These will be capable of measuring humidity and temperature and relay it back to the master station. These data relays could be once per minute for immediate access to the data, or in bursts every 10-15 minutes to conserve power. There should also be a local display of the data. While they are easy to access, power consumption should be kept to a minimum.
3. Outdoor remote station. The plan only calls for one of these, though a modified indoor remote station could also be used, if it can withstand the conditions. This stations should measure humidity, pressure, temperature, wind direction and wind speed. Power consumption should be minimal, and best case would be the possibility to run this station of a solar cell.
